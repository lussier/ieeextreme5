\section{Question J:\\Resistors Network}

\subsection{Task}
Can you help the puzzle-master check the solutions he receives by writing 
a program which, given a resistor network computes the overall resistance 
between "a" and "z"?

Note: we only ask you to solve networks which are parallel – series; as a hint see the clip at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-DxWK5Wzzc

\subsection{Input}
The first line contains the number of problems. Each one of the other 
lines contains pairs of letters to mark the endpoint of a 1-Ohm resistor.

\subsection{Output}
The overall resistance, given in 4-digits accuracy.

\subsection{Sample Input}
4\\
ab bc cd dz\\
az az az\\
ab bc cz ad de ef fz\\
ab bc cd de ef fg gz az bg cf\\
Note: New line is needed at the end of the last line

\subsection{Sample Output}
4.0000\\
0.3333\\
1.7143\\
0.7321
