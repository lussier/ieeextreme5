\section{Question H:\\Tracking billiard balls}

\subsection{Description}
A set of N billiard balls are set on a one-dimensional table. The table is 1 meter long,
set north-south with two pockets at either side. Each ball has zero width and there is
no friction so it is moving with a fixed velocity of either northward or southward and
bounces back in a perfect elastic collision from other balls it encounter on its way (or
drop into one of the pockets).
Your job is to keep track of the balls movements.

\subsection{Task}
Please write a program that gets the initial place, speed and direction of all
the balls and gives the position of a specific ball after t seconds.

\subsection{Input}

The first line contains the number of scenarios.
Each one of the other lines in the input contains a scenario:
The first number, N, is the number of balls; followed by N pairs of numbers: the
distance in centimeters from the south end of the table and the speed (positive speed
meaning it moves northward); the last two numbers are the number i of the target ball
you should track and the time T in seconds.

\subsection{Output}

The output is a single number for each line which is the place (distance in centimeters
from the south end of the table) of the tracked ball after T seconds.
Note: There is no new line character at the end of the result.
