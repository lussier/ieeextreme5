\section{Question W:\\Maya Diet}

\subsection{Description}
Maya wants to switch to a healthy diet. An optimal diet consists 
of C gm of carbohydrates, F gm of fat, P gm of protein. Any other
 element in the food (represented by O) is considered unwanted. 
 She procured a table containing the carbohydrates, fat, protein 
 and other contents (all in gms per serving) of some healthy foods. 
 Her goal is to consume at least C, F and P gms of carbohydrates, 
 fat and protein respectively yet minimize the overall in-take 
 (in gms) of food. You need to help her choose the ideal 
 combination from the table.

\subsection{Inputs}
The program must read input from standard-input. The input format 
is as follows. The first line contains the optimal carbohydrate, 
fat and protein consumption (in gm), separated by spaces. 
The second line contains k – the number of food items.
Each of the following k lines contains - name, carbohydrate, fat, 
protein and other contents of a food item, separated by spaces. 
The weight of a serving of a particular food item is the sum of 
C, P, F, O values on the corresponding line.
The name of food items are non-space ASCII strings. 
The maximum value for K is 10. The maximum weight of a serving is 1000 gms. 
Each of the c, p, f, o values are whole numbers (integers >= 0).

\subsection{Output}
Output is printed onto the standard-output.
The output must contain k lines, each line containing the name 
of a food item followed by the number
of servings Maya should consume, separated by space and in 
the same sequence. If no solution exists for the problem, the
output must be just one word - "Null".

Note: There is no new line character at the end of the result.
